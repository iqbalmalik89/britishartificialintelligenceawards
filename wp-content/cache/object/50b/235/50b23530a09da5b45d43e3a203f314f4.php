Each PowerTalk event is attended by the 100 men and women detailed within our Power100 list, 10 of whom are invited to come and give the greatest talk of their lives.

After the launch of each Power 100 list and the publication of the Power 100 Parliamentary Review we gather the most engaged members of the Power 100 community for sector specific brainstorms, discussions, performances and workshops culminating in an eclectic program of main stage PowerTalks.

More than a thousand people attend this one-day conference where Power 100 speakers appear on the main stage to give 15 minute talks and shorter presentations on best practice ideas worth spreading.
