We gather anywhere we can to share ideas and develop exciting projects. Our team can choose to work from home, hot desking, or sitting on the beachâ€¦ whatever helps them to bring in the results.

It takes a diverse set of skills, personalities and points of view to build a humming innovation business. Weâ€™re powered by our people, an energized group of innovation activists, original thinkers and passionate practitioners.

Our method of working has inspired our people to expand on their skills and ideas. We hold regular brainstorms, when we take time away from our normal work to explore new projects that give our people the freedom to think big and innovate without the fear of failing. We encourage each other to try new ideas and fix problems because we believe trying and failing is better than not trying at all.

At The British Publishing Company everyone has a chance for success, so anyone holds the possibility of creating the next revolutionary idea. We also take on, develop, and invest in third-party event ideas and produce them in conjunction with the individual or organisation to bring it to fruition.
